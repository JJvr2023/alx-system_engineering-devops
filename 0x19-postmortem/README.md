Postmortem: Mystery Slowdown in E-commerce Platform (Invented Scenario)
Issue Summary:

Duration: 3 hours, starting at 14:00 PST on February 17, 2024, ending at 17:00 PST.

Impact: E-commerce platform experienced a significant slowdown in page load times and checkout processes. Approximately 40% of users encountered delays, leading to cart abandonment and lost revenue.

Root Cause: Memory leak within the product recommendation engine causing performance degradation on the application server.

Timeline:

14:00 PST: Monitoring alerts trigger on increased response times and server resource usage.
14:15 PST: Engineers investigate application logs and server metrics, initially suspecting database query slowness.
14:30 PST: Database optimization efforts show minimal impact, prompting investigation into application code and resource consumption.
15:00 PST: Memory usage on the application server identified as rising steadily, raising suspicion of a potential memory leak.
15:30 PST: Incident escalated to developers specializing in the recommendation engine framework.
16:00 PST: Developers isolate the source of the leak to a specific library call within the recommendation engine.
16:30 PST: Hotfix patch deployed to isolate the problematic library call, alleviating memory pressure.
17:00 PST: Server performance recovers, application response times return to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the slowdown was a memory leak within the product recommendation engine. A specific library call was identified as failing to properly release allocated memory, leading to a continuous rise in server memory usage. This, in turn, caused performance degradation for the entire application.

The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix patch that addressed the problematic library call, ensuring proper memory management.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring on memory usage per application component for faster detection of memory leaks.
Enhance logging: Include detailed memory allocation and release information in application logs for easier troubleshooting.
Strengthen unit testing: Incorporate memory leak detection tools into unit tests for proactive identification of memory management issues.
Review third-party libraries: Update or replace the problematic library with a more memory-efficient alternative.
Conduct code reviews: Regular code reviews with a focus on memory management practices can help prevent future leaks.
This incident highlights the importance of proactive monitoring, detailed logging, and robust testing practices in web applications. By implementing the measures outlined, we can minimize the risk of similar performance issues in the future.
